# final_project
Final Project for DSCI552 at USC

NOTE: Before running the code, a file system needs to be made that is not established by the code. It is as follows:

data/train/pass/
data/train/fail/

data/test/pass/
data/test/fail/

After this file directory has been established then the code will run and download images to these files.

_____________________________

Included in the files there will likely be two Juypter Notebook files, one is Final Project - SUBMITTED and the other is Final Project - LATE because I wanted to make additional comments and changes to the code just after the deadline. I wanted to be clear that there is a version that is submitted by the deadline but that I wanted to make occasional cosmetic changes.
