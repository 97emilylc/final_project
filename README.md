# final_project
Final Project for DSCI552 at USC

NOTE: Before running the code, a file system needs to be made that is not established by the code. It is as follows:

data/train/pass/
data/train/fail/

data/test/pass/
data/test/fail/

After this file directory has been established then the code will run and download images to these files.
